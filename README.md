### Welcome ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full stack web developer with a passion for problem solving. My love for problem solving turned into a love for video games, so much so I made a career in it. Now I've turned from pro gamer to programmer. I have experience in JavaScript, Python, React, Redux, Postgresql, HTML, CSS, Node.js, Flask, SQLAlchemy, Pug, and more.
